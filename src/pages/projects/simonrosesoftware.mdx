<a href="https://simonrose.software" target="_blank">
  Simon Rose Software
</a> is a static website to advertise my freelance software engineering business.
It is built using <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/" target="_blank">
  Nuxt.js
</a> and hosted on Google Firebase. It uses a Firebase function for the email sending
(so as to keep the site static) and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind</a> for CSS.
