WARP™ is a single-player video game developed using DirectX 9 API’s, which puts the player behind the controls of a space craft as it ventures through the realms of space, avoiding hazardous mines and collecting fuel cells to sustain sufficient speed to remain inside the gravity field of the wormhole.

The aim of the game is to maintain as fast a speed as possible whilst collecting fuel cells in sequence to generate the greatest score, colliding with mines will hinder your efforts and travelling too slow will prove fatal.
