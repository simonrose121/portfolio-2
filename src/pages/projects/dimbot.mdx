Dimbot is a puzzle game based on{" "} <a href="http://lightbot.com/" target="_blank"> Lightbot</a>. It is written using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, AngularJS, Express.js and Node.js), and uses <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/" target="_blank"> {" "} three.js </a>{" "} for the 3D graphics. The source code can be found{" "} <a href="https://github.com/simonrose121/dimbot">here</a>.

The game was used to conduct a research study for my Masters investigating the effects of visual programming environments on problem solving ability in young children (age 6 and 7). It has 2 different versions: one for ScratchJr-like (block-based) instructions and one for the Lightbot instruction approach. The key difference between the two is that ScratchJr-like instructions can be added to the program but are not executed unless attached to a 'start' block, whereas all the instructions in the Lightbot style program are executed.

A conference paper describing this application and the research study it was used in was presented at the <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0868/960977cf6c6dc7132be20b6f5a6d7ee1649d.pdf" target="_blank" >10th European Conference for Game Based Learning</a>. A follow up article was published in the <a href="http://shura.shu.ac.uk/16235/8/Rose-Explorationoftheroleofvisualprogramming%28VoR%29.pdf" target="_blank" >Electronic Journal of E-Learning</a>.
