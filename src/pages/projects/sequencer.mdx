Sequencer is a web application that is designed to test the sequencing ability of young children, and was used in a research study with children aged 5 and 6. It has players order 4 cards that make up a story. The app contains 30 stories, which were designed and drawn by myself and <a href="https://www.artstation.com/calebobrien" target="_blank">Caleb O'Brien</a> and depict sequences in five categories (which were used as an indicator of difficulty):

1. Mechanical 1 (objects interacting causally with each other)
2. Mechanical 2 (people and objects acting causally on each other)
3. Behavioural 1 (a single person acting out everyday routines)
4. Behavioural 2 (people acting in social routines)
5. Intentional (people acting in everyday activities requiring the attribution of mental states)

It was written using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, AngularJS, Express.js and Node.js) with TypeScript.
