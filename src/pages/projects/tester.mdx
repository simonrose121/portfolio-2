Tester is an application that tests non-verbal reasoning ability. It is written using AngularJS, Express.js and Node.js and uses DocumentDB for storage (it was hosted on Microsoft's Azure platform). The source code can be found{" "} <a href="https://github.com/simonrose121/tester" target="_blank">here</a>.

The application can be reused for other questions (these are loaded in using JSON). However, in it's current state it contains questions adapted from non-verbal reasoning worksheets for Y2 (6 and 7 years old) children. It was used as a pre-test for a research study on the effect of visual programming environments on young children (in which <a href="/projects/dimbot">Dimbot</a> was used for the main part of the study.)
